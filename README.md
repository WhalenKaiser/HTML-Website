# HTML-Website

This website is a place for me to showcase some of my programming skills.  The website itself will include using an API and JavaScript and hosting on a server I spun up myself through AWS.  The projects I talk about will be examples of my work as well.  I've found that job hunting in the UK involves a lot of people saying I don't have experience.  Well, now I can show my experience, instead of claiming I've learned something.
